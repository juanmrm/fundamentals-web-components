Most CSS codebases are sometimes developed without any structure or naming conventions -> unmaintainable CSS in the long term.

BEM (BLOCK-ELEMENT-MODIFIER) approach ensures that everyone who develop a website works with a single codebase and speaks the same language. 

BLOCK
    Encapsulates a standalone entity that is meaningful on its own. While blocks can be nested and interact with each other, semantically they remain equal; there is no precedence or hierarchy. 
    
    Naming: 
        Names may consist of Latin letters, digits, and dashes. To form a CSS class, add a short prefix for namespacing: .block   
    HTML: 
        Any DOM node can be a block if it accepts a class name.
        
        <div class="block">...</div>
    
    CSS: 
        - Use class name selector only
        - No tag name or ids
        - No dependency on other blocks/elements on a page

        pe: .block { color: #042; }

ELEMENT
    Parts of a block and have no standalone meaning. Any element is semantically tied to its block.

    Naming: 
        Element names may consist of Latin letters, digits, dashes and underscores. CSS class is formed as block name plus two underscores plus element name: .block__elem
    HTML: 
        Any DOM node within a block can be an element. Within a given block, all elements are semantically equal.
        
        <div class="block">
	        ...
            <span class="block__elem"></span>
        </div>
    
    CSS: 
        - Use class name selector only
        - No tag name or ids
        - No dependency on other blocks/elements on a page
    
        Good
            .block__elem { color: #042; }

        Bad
            .block .block__elem { color: #042; }
	        div.block__elem { color: #042; }

MODIFIER
    Flags on blocks or elements. Use them to change appearance, behavior or state.

    Naming:
        Modifier names may consist of Latin letters, digits, dashes and underscores. CSS class is formed as block’s or element’s name plus two dashes: .block--mod or .block__elem--mod and .block--color-black with .block--color-red. 
        Spaces in complicated modifiers are replaced by dash.

    HTML: 
        Modifier is an extra class name which you add to a block/element DOM node. Add modifier classes only to blocks/elements they modify, and keep the original class.

        Good
            <div class="block block--mod">...</div>
                <div class="block block--size-big
                    block--shadow-yes">...</div>
        
        Bad
            <div class="block--mod">...</div>
    
    CSS:
        - Use modifier class name as selector

            .block--hidden { }
                To alter elements based on a block-level modifier:

            .block--mod .block__elem { }
                Element modifier:

            .block__elem--mod { }
