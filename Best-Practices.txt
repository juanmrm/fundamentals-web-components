Checklist:
  
  Shadow DOM:
    - Create a shadow root to encapsulate styles
    - Create your shadow root in the constructor
    - Place any children the element creates into its shadow root
    - Set a :host display style (e.g. block, inline-block, flex) unless you prefer the default of inline.
    - Add a :host display style that respects the hidden attribute for supporting it: :host([hidden]) { display: none }.
  
  Attributes and properties:
    - Do not override author-set, global attributes
    - Always accept primitive data (strings, numbers, booleans) as either attributes or properties
    - Aim to keep primitive data attributes and properties in sync, reflecting from property to attribute, and vice versa.
    - Aim to only accept rich data (objects, arrays) as properties not in attributes
    - Do not reflect rich data properties to attributes
    - Consider checking for properties that may have been set before the element upgraded
    - Do not self-apply classes: express component state using attributes. The class attribute is generally considered to be owned by the developer using your element.   

  Events:
    - Dispatch events in response to internal component activity
    - Do not dispatch events in response to the host setting a property (downward data flow)
